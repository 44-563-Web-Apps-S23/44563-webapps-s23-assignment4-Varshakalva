    <h4> A DOLLAR by David Pinski </h4>

    <p> [_Stepping toward the sign-post, reading the directions on the boards, and explaining to the approaching fellow-actors._] </p>
<p> That way </p> <p> [_pointing to right and swinging the valise to indicate the direction_] </p>
<p> is thirty miles. This way </p> <p>[_pointing to left_] </p> <p> is forty-five--and that
way it is thirty-six. Now choose for yourself the town that you'll never
reach to-day. <br> The nearest way for us is back to where we came from,
whence we were escorted with the most splendid catcalls that ever
crowned our histrionic successes. </p>

   <p class="direction"> [_Exhausted._] </p>
 <p> Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my
perspiration? It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth. </p>

<p class="speech"> <h6 class="COMEDIAN"> COMEDIAN. </h6>
<p> Stand on your head, then, and let your perspiration water a more fruitful soil. </p>

<p> Oh! </p>
    <p> [_He drops his arms, the bundles fall down. He then sinks down onto
     one of them and wipes off the perspiration, <br> moving his hand wearily
     over his face. The_ TRAGEDIAN _and the_ "OLD MAN" _approach the
     post and read the signs_. </p>

<p class="speech"> <h6 class="TRAGEDIAN"> TRAGEDIAN. </h6> 
   <p class="direction"> [_In a deep, dramatic voice._] </p>
      <p> It's hopeless! It's hopeless! </p>

<p class="speech"> <h6 class="OLD MAN"> OLD MAN. </h6>
   <p class="direction"> [_Lets go his end of the trunk._] </p>
 </p> Mm. Another stop. </p>
 <p class="direction"> [TRAGEDIAN _sits himself down on the trunk in a tragico-heroic
     pose, knees wide apart, right elbow on right knee, <br> left hand on
     left leg, head slightly bent toward the right_. COMEDIAN _puts down
     the valises and rolls a cigarette_. <br> The "OLD MAN" _also sits down
     upon the trunk, head sunk upon his breast_. </p>

<p class="speech"> <h6 class="VILLAIN"> VILLAIN. </h6> 
<p> Thirty miles to the nearest town! Thirty miles! </p>
