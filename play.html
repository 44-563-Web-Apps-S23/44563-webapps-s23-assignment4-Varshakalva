     COMEDIAN. [_Stepping toward the sign-post, reading the directions on the
     boards, and explaining to the approaching fellow-actors._] That way
     [_pointing to right and swinging the valise to indicate the direction_]
     is thirty miles. This way [_pointing to left_] is forty-five--and that
     way it is thirty-six. Now choose for yourself the town that you'll never
     reach to-day. The nearest way for us is back to where we came from,
     whence we were escorted with the most splendid catcalls that ever
     crowned our histrionic successes. <br>
     VILLAIN. [_Exhausted._] Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my
     perspiration? It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth. <br>
     COMEDIAN. Stand on your head, then, and let your perspiration water a
     more fruitful soil. <br>     
     VILLAIN. Oh! <br>
          [_He drops his arms, the bundles fall down. He then sinks down onto
          one of them and wipes off the perspiration, moving his hand wearily
          over his face. The_ TRAGEDIAN _and the_ "OLD MAN" _approach the
          post and read the signs_. <br>
     TRAGEDIAN. [_In a deep, dramatic voice._] It's hopeless! It's hopeless! <br>
     [_He lets go his end of the trunk._ <br>
     "OLD MAN." [_Lets go his end of the trunk._] Mm. Another stop. <br>
     [TRAGEDIAN _sits himself down on the trunk in a tragico-heroic
          pose, knees wide apart, right elbow on right knee, left hand on
          left leg, head slightly bent toward the right_. COMEDIAN _puts down
          the valises and rolls a cigarette_. The "OLD MAN" _also sits down
          upon the trunk, head sunk upon his breast_. <br>   
     VILLAIN. Thirty miles to the nearest town! Thirty miles!
